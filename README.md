## Convergence_test_for_metal_surfaces
This script will eventually allow to run in an automated way all the initial convergence tests for a metal surface investigation in VASP. Such tests are K points and ENCUT convergence, as well as the surface energy vs. layer thickness evaluated through a modified Fiorentini-Methfessel method 

Every change must be notified through a comment inside the code as well as any idea for new implementation.
